*BMI and VO2 Max Calculator:-
This C project is designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and estimate the Maximum Volume of Oxygen (VO2 max) based on user inputs. The program prompts the user to enter certain parameters like height, weight, age, etc. and computes the BMI and VO2 max using standard formulas.

*Features:-
Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
Estimates Maximum Volume of Oxygen (VO2 max) based on user's age, weight, and resting heart rate.
Simple command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.

*Formula Used:-
BMI Formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
VO2 Max Estimation Formula:
VO2 max = 15.3 * (max heart rate / resting heart rate)

*Input Requirements:-
Weight (in kilograms)
Height (in meters)
Age (in years)
Resting heart rate (beats per minute)
